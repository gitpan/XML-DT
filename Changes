        - Bug in POD...
	- problems with the changes on UNICODE
       (In the present version of perl 5.6) some operations add some
   magick information to the strings saying that are unicoded!!!
       If you change them to other formats, they still keep that hidden 
   information and when you try to concate them, perl will unicode them again
       Solution changing to        tr .... UC

0.16      Oct  16         2000
	- problems with the changes on UNICODE
        - 0.15 does not work with perl 5.005 (no tr .... UC available)..
       Solution: "use bytes" if we find it.
         eval("use bytes") if ($inc{bytes.pm}) { require and import...}  

0.17      Oct  30         2000
        - added a -type => ZERO   that don't processes its subelements and
       return "". It is good to avoid visiting certain parts of the document,
       and for better performance.

0.18      Nov  18         2000
        - Bug fixed in dtd generator function: mkdtdskel
        - possibility of passing parameters do toxml:
              toxml(tag, {...atributes...}, contents)
        - pathdt functions with path's instead of tag

0.19      Nov  30         2000
        - better pathdt functions with
              //aaa[@att='asdasd'] (see pod file)

0.20      ...  ..         2001
	- installs mkdtskel shell script to be used quickly
	- removed html files from package. User can do that with pod2html
