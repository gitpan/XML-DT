        - Bug in POD...
	- problems with the changes on UNICODE
       (In the present version of perl 5.6) some operations add some
   magick information to the strings saying that are unicoded!!!
       If you change them to other formats, they still keep that hidden 
   information and when you try to concate them, perl will unicode them again
       Solution changing to        tr .... UC

0.16      Oct  16         2000
	- problems with the changes on UNICODE
        - 0.15 does not work with perl 5.005 (no tr .... UC available)..
       Solution: "use bytes" if we find it.
         eval("use bytes") if ($inc{bytes.pm}) { require and import...}
